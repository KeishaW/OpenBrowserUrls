# OpenBrowserUrls
Open browser URLs in any browser installed on your machine

Currently works on Windows machines, with Google Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari for Windows.

See Program.cs in OpenBrowserUrls.App project for examples on how to use.

Private Mode does not yet work with all browsers, (like Microsoft Edge and Safari for Windows), but works with the others.
